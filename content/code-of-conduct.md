## A welcome, friendly event for all

This ISYA is intended for learning and networking as well as future collaborations. The participation of every attendee is valued and we want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the school and to abide by the [IAU's anti-harassment guidelines](/anti-harassment-policy.pdf) and [NRF's anti-harassment policy](/NRF-Policy-HR-WRM404-Sexual-Harassment-and-Grievance.pdf). Any issues can be brought to the confidential attention of the organizers. Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
